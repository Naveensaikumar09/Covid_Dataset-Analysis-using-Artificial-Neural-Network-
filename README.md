**Data Points as in original dataset:**
-	Age (Number)
-	Body Temperature (Normal, Moderate, High)
- Chronic Disease (no/yes)
- Breathing Issue (no/yes)
- Blood O2 level in % (Number)
- Needed hospitalization (yes/no)
  
**Steps for Analysis**
1.	Data Preprocessing
-	Importing libraries
-	Importing dataset
-	Handling missing data
-	Encoding categorical data (for body_temperature,chronic_disease, breathing_issue and needed_hopsitlaization)
-	Splitting training and test data
-	Feature scaling
  
2.	Analysis and Prediction
-	ANN implementation
